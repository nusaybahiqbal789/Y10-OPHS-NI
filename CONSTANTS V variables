#this is a comment
#variables versus constants
#variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1name="Spero's stars"
Team2name="Croydon's kebabs"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variables can not start with a number
#e.g.1teamname="croydons kebabs"
#this will cause a syntax error

#variables cannot have a space in the name 
#e.g.1teamname="croydons kebabs"
#tghis will be a syntax error

#this is an example of a contant
FREETHROW=1
TWOPOINTER=2
THREEPOINTER=3

#the values in a CONSTANT do not change
